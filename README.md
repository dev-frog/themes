# Hard Hacker Theme

A visually comfortable dark theme that is suitable for prolonged use. It differs from the typical blueish dark themes and aims to express a unique style with a more futuristic color palette.

The color inspiration comes from some cyberpunk-style art works. However, neon color schemes commonly seen in cyberpunk styles are not suitable for prolonged staring, thus the saturation of the colors has been reduced.

Features:
* Suitable for prolonged use
* Color-blind friendly
* Good readability
* Futuristic
* Provides high-contrast options
